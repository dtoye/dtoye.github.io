Well that’s a lie… It will be a kill team from One Page rules Grimdark Futire - Firefight.I always wanted an Iron Hands team so I decided to build one!. So I bought the Phobos Strike Team, Iron Father Feirros and the Iron Hands Primaris Upgrade pack. So a total of 11 miniatures.Things to keep in mind I’m not going to win awards. And that’s OK. I do not want to be paralysed by options and paint schemes and not get’er done. I will attempt to document all the steps but I will not do a step by step for each colour. The goal is to actually play! I will keep a record of all the paints used. April 1st 2023 is the deadline to have a 250pt team ready for battle. The team will probably not be legal in a tournament. It will not be 100% accurate I’m going to choose to build models that I think are cool. They may not be the best choice but I need to “not care”.Chapter InfoNames Brother Sergeant Naim Morvox of Clave Arx, Clan RaukaanLayoutHere is m first challenge. I wonder if the upgrade set is compatible with the kill team.Each sprue has the following: 5x Iron Hands MK X power armour shoulder pads (designed for use with Hellblasters/Intercessors) 1x Iron Hands MK X power armour shoulder pad (designed for Characters or Sergeants from Hellblasters/Intercessors squads) 2x Iron Hands Gravis armour shoulder pad (designed for use with Aggressors) 1x Iron Hands Gravis armour shoulder pad (designed for Characters or Sergeants from Aggressors squads) 2x Iron Hands character bare heads 1x Iron Hands helmeted head 1x left arm with bionics 1x right arm with bionic hand, holding a bolt rifle 2x purity seals 1x pauldron 4x Iron Hands decorationsI’m pretty sure the heads and bits are compatible but I wonder about the arms and the shoulder pads.Looks like the shoulder pads are different. The ones with the kit have this little cut out which I assume is to give them better mobility. I’m going to try using the upgrades just because the look cooler.There are 27 possible variants in the Phobos set.Model 1 - Incursor SargeantWe have three options for this model. Two are Infiltrators and one Incursor variants. Within a Primaris Space Marines army, Infiltrators fulfil the role of an area-denial unit – and they’re amazing at it. By combining their ability to be deployed from Concealed Positions……and their Omni-scramblers, which force enemy reserves to deploy further away, they can ensure that part of the battlefield remains in your control. Just like their Infiltrator brethren, the Incursors can operate from Concealed Positions. However, they have a different weapon loadout – they carry the occulus bolt carbine, a deadly weapon that denies the enemy the use of cover thanks to its advanced targeting system.I’ve decided to go with variant #3.WIPModel 2 - Infiltrator Sabateur Carrying a deadly array of melta charges, super-krak munitions and even anti-plant canisters into battle, the Infiltrator Saboteur is well prepared to rig any target for destruction. This task completed, they fall back swiftly before triggering a blast like the Emperor’s wrath.Model 3 - Infiltgrator Helix Adept A Helix Adept is the title given to certain Primaris Marines who serve with the Vanguard Space Marines. They are usually assigned to serve with Infiltrator Squads, who often have their own medicae specialists. These warriors receive additional training from the Apothecarion, and stand ready to ascend to the role of full Primaris Apothecary should a tragic loss occur. Meanwhile, they practise their craft in the Vanguard formations, utilising the Helix Gauntlet – a scaled-down version of an Apothecary’s Narthecium tool – to carry out their duties. Their duty is to provide battlefield first aid to their battle-brothers and collect their gene-seed for the Chapter if they should fall in combat.Model 4 - Incursor Warrior Incursors are potent offensive skirmishers. They use oracular auspexes slaved to their occulus bolt carbines to spot enemy targets, even through solid walls. They then press swiftly upon their foes’ positions before engaging in bloody, one-sided firefights with the outmanoeuvred enemy.Model 5 - Infiltrator Commsman The Infiltrator Commsman acts as a strategic nexus upon the battlefield, a conduit through which vox-exchanges and intelligence inloads pass like lightning. The presence of such a battle-brother increases the strike team’s versatility and swiftness of action.Model 6 - Infiltrator Veteran The most experienced Infiltrator battle-brothers stalk their enemies like armoured gheists, wielding weaponry selected from their Chapter’s most rarefied armouries, each one augmented through the careful attentions of master artificers. So-armed, they can act as the nemeses of any foe.Model 7 - Incursor Minelayer Some Incursors carry heavy haywire mines into battle, planting them at pre-cogitated nexuses of probable enemy movement. The electrophantasmic blasts of these weapons can banish machine spirits from enemy wargear and cripple augmetic enhancements.Model 8 - Infiltrator Warrior The Infiltrators who fight as part of Phobos Strike Teams are swift and aggressive in thought and deed, even by the standards of their warrior brotherhood. Few foes can long evade their pinpoint volleys or the bone-crushing blows of their armoured fists.Model 9 (pose 13) - Infiltrator Warrior The Infiltrators who fight as part of Phobos Strike Teams are swift and aggressive in thought and deed, even by the standards of their warrior brotherhood. Few foes can long evade their pinpoint volleys or the bone-crushing blows of their armoured fists.Incursor Marksman As though the combination of a highly trained Space Marine and a potent mark of bolt carbine were not deadly enough, the Incursor Marksman employs his Divinator-class auspex to precognitively track where his targets will be, then places killing shots accordinglyWIPAssembliesDon’t look at the flash lines…PrimingI primed with my airbrush the miniatures with black then I primed them again with gray from above. The top has more grey then the bottom. I decided to add some grey to the underside to make it not so black.Black ArmourI painted the armour plates with Army Painter Gun Metal then I painted Black Templar Contrast on top of it. I also painted the Black Templar over the grey primed under garment.Step 1 - Gun MetalStep 2 - Black TemplarIron FatherRandom NotesTrying out Liquitex masking fluid cover parts of the model that will be glued via plastic cement. Once removed, it will allow the cement to “melt” the parts together.

The previous owner ran 10 strands of cabling. He even had a BIX panel in the wiring closet. But back in the day, you only really needed 2 pair of twisted pair. So he used one cable for two connections. Pretty sure the crosstalk would cause grief for gigE connections. When we reno’ed the house, I got the contractor to hide the cables back in the wall since I was not using any wired connection anymore.Fast forward to 2022… now I want gigE speed from my workstation to the core and I want the three mesh access points to have a wired connection to the core as well.t568b wiring standardThis is the basic cable that you buy " }, { "title": "Homelab Day 2-3 / 100", "url": "/posts/homelab-day-2-3-100/", "categories": "homelab", "tags": "hardware, networking, vlan", "date": "2022-07-16 18:10:00 -0400", "snippet": "NotesThinking of putting my gear in a rack.
