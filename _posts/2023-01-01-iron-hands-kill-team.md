# Start of the project

I decided to *start* and *finish* a Warhammer 40K kill team. Well that's a lie... It will be a kill team from One Page rules [Grimdark Futire - Firefight](https://onepagerules.com/portfolio/grimdark-future-firefight/).

I always wanted an *Iron Hands* team so I decided to build one!. So I bought the Phobos Strike Team, Iron Father Feirros and the Iron Hands Primaris Upgrade pack. So a total of 11 miniatures.

# Things to keep in mind

* I'm not going to win awards. And that's OK. I do not want to be paralysed by options and paint schemes and not get'er done.
* I will attempt to document all the steps but I will not do a step by step for each colour. 
* The goal is to actually play!
* I will keep a record of all the paints used.
* April 1st 2023 is the deadline to have a 250pt team ready for battle. 
* The team will probably not be legal in a tournament. It will not be 100% accurate
* I'm going to choose to build models that I think are cool. They may not be the best choice but I need to "not care".

Here is m first challenge. I wonder if the upgrade set is compatible with the kill team.

Each sprue has the following:

- 5x Iron Hands MK X power armour shoulder pads (designed for use with Hellblasters/Intercessors)
- 1x Iron Hands MK X power armour shoulder pad (designed for Characters or Sergeants from Hellblasters/Intercessors squads)
- 2x Iron Hands Gravis armour shoulder pad (designed for use with Aggressors)
- 1x Iron Hands Gravis armour shoulder pad (designed for Characters or Sergeants from Aggressors squads)
- 2x Iron Hands character bare heads
- 1x Iron Hands helmeted head
- 1x left arm with bionics
- 1x right arm with bionic hand, holding a bolt rifle
- 2x purity seals
- 1x pauldron
- 4x Iron Hands decorations

)

I'm pretty sure the heads and bits are compatible but I wonder about the arms and the shoulder pads.

Looks like the shoulder pads are different. The ones with the kit have this little cut out which I assume is to give them better mobility. I'm going to try using the upgrades just because the look cooler.

There are 27 possible variants in the Phobos set. 

## Model 1 - Sargeant

We have three options for this model. Two are *Infiltrators* and one *Incursor* variants. 

>Within a Primaris Space Marines army, Infiltrators fulfil the role of an area-denial unit – and they’re amazing at it. By combining their ability to be deployed from Concealed Positions…
…and their Omni-scramblers, which force enemy reserves to deploy further away, they can ensure that part of the battlefield remains in your control.
>
>Just like their Infiltrator brethren, the Incursors can operate from Concealed Positions. However, they have a different weapon loadout – they carry the occulus bolt carbine, a deadly weapon that denies the enemy the use of cover thanks to its advanced targeting system.
