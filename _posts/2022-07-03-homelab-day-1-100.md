# Day 1

This is not really day 1 but it is the first one where I'm documenting my lab. Hopefully this will help me in the future.

## Stuff I researched
* VLANS
* Good NIC Intel 0h092p (4 port gigE)
* My proxmox server is using a realtek NIC. Not the greatest at all for VLAN's

## Maintenance
* Upgraded warp, impulse, & hel
* upgraded firmware on managed switch
* Patched and upgraded octopi 
* Backup of hel and managed switch
* Upgrade WSL to version 2

## Installs
* Ansible on wulgar

## Changes

For WSL, to get dns working i had to edit /etc/wsl.conf
```
dtoye@wulfgar:~$ cat /etc/wsl.conf
[network]
generateResolvConf = true
```
