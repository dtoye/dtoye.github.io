# Re-using the old wiring

When we bought this house in 2000, it came with 5 CATe throughout the house. The previous owner ran 10 strands of cabling. He even had a BIX panel in the wiring closet. But back in the day, you only really needed 2 pair of twisted pair. So he used one cable for two connections. Pretty sure the crosstalk would cause grief for gigE connections. When we reno'ed the house, I got the contractor to hide the cables back in the wall since I was not using any wired connection anymore. 

Fast forward to 2022... now I want gigE speed from my workstation to the core and I want the three mesh access points to have a wired connection to the core as well. 

## t568b wiring standard
This is the basic cable that you buy
