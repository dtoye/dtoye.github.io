# Notes
Thinking of putting my gear in a rack. 
Watched this video https://youtu.be/IdQGpKcBgwo. I really like how he explained his choices. 

Here is the link of gear from the video. https://kit.co/lawrencesystems/homelab-rack-build

# Proxmox and VLAN

So I wanted to muck about VLAN but I need another card install in my proxmos server.
 Bought a dual port 2.5GbE card https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07XJ8CMQX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

 Had a lot of problems getting it and the built-in network card to work. Had to compile a network driver and change the setting of /etc/network/interface. The name of the card changed so I had to update the network config.

 ## pfsense
 
 | VLAN Tag | Description | Subnet           |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 100      | Servers     | 192.168.100.0/24 |
| 200      | Proxmox     | 192.168.200.0/24 |
|          |             |                  |

Don't forget to add a firewall rule and dchp scope for the new vlans


 # Terraform

## Couple of gotchas

1. "target_node" is the short name of the proxmox host where you are planning to deploy the vm's. In my case it is "warp"
2. Change the network interface to "vmbr1" which is the other network card that contains the trunks
