From left to right:

* Army Painter - Speed Paint - Hive Dweller Purple
* Army Painter - Metallics - Royal Purple
* Reaper - MSP - Runix Glow
* Vallejo - Game Color - Warlord Purple
* Reaper - MSP HD - Gem Purple

One coat of paint does not seem to be enough. The speed paint looks decent. In second place is the Runix Glow.
